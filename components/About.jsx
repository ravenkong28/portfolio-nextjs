            I started web developement in 2013 managing multiple e-commerce
            websites on CMS platforms such as WordPress, BigCommerce, and
            Shopify. I have experience working directly with clients and taking
            mock wireframes all the way to deployed applications. In my spare
            time I run Code Commerce, a Youtube channel where I teach web
            developement and various front-end technologies.
